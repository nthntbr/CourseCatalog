### Class: `Local_Course_Catalogue`

#### Purpose
Manages a local catalogue of course data, allowing for searching and navigating through the courses.

#### Attributes
- `directory_path`: A string storing the path to the directory containing course data files.
- `course_data`: A Pandas DataFrame to hold course data.
- `all_search_results`: A DataFrame to store the results of a search query.
- `current_displayed_search_results`: A DataFrame to store the current set of search results displayed to the user.
- `num_of_search_results_shown`: An integer indicating the number of search results currently shown.
- `current_displayed_search_results_start_iterator`: An integer marking the start of the current displayed search results in `all_search_results`.
- `current_displayed_search_results_end_iterator`: An integer marking the end of the current displayed search results in `all_search_results`.

#### Methods
- `__init__(self, directory_path)`: Constructor that initializes the class attributes and invokes `collect_course_data()`.
- `collect_course_data(self)`: Collects course data from CSV files in the specified directory and loads it into `course_data`.
- `top_results(self)`: Returns the top search results based on the `current_displayed_search_results_end_iterator`.
- `show_next_n_results(self)`: Updates iterators to show the next set of search results and returns them.
- `show_previous_n_results(self)`: Updates iterators to show the previous set of search results and returns them.
- `search_course_catalogue_by_terms(...)`: Searches the course catalogue based on various parameters like course code, level, credit hours, description keyphrase, terms offered, and grade mode.

#### Example Usage
At the end of the script, there is an example of how to use the `Local_Course_Catalogue` class. It involves creating an instance of the class, performing an initial search, and then navigating through the search results.

#### Additional Notes
- The class relies heavily on the Pandas library for data manipulation.
- It's designed to work with course data stored in CSV files.
- The search functionality is quite flexible, allowing for a variety of search parameters.
- There are placeholders for potentially expanding this into a RESTful API.
- The script includes a testing section that demonstrates the class's capabilities.
